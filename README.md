# Video Convertor

**Project README: Video Conversion Using Golang, Ffmpeg, and Gin Framework** 🎬


## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate the process of converting a video file using Golang with Ffmpeg and the Gin web framework. By leveraging these technologies, users can upload a video file through a web interface, have it processed with Ffmpeg for conversion, and then download the new video file.

Please note 📌 that this is an educational project, so to deploy it in a production environment, you should finalize 🏁 the project and ensure it meets production standards.
